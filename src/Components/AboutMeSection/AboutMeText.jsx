        Hi, I’m Rijul Sharma from the beautiful hills of Himachal Pradesh. I’m
        just starting my journey in the world of web development, learning and
        improving every day. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind,
        and Bootstrap to create simple, responsive websites. My goal is to keep
        building my skills, take on new challenges, and grow into a confident,
        skilled developer.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5 text-white text-xl">
        Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, staying curious about
        how things work, and finding creative ways to solve problems. I love
        connecting with people, sharing knowledge, and learning from different
        perspectives. Whether it’s technology, design, or everyday life, I
        believe in continuous growth and trying new things.
      </p>
